# Code Challenge

Conduct "FizzBuzz" on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Specifications

- Read all of these instructions carefully.
- Name things exactly as described.
- Do all your work in a your `data-structures-and-algorithms` public repository.
- Create a new branch in your repo named as noted below.
- Follow the language-specific instructions for the challenge type listed below.
- Update the "Table of Contents" - in the README at the root of the repository - with a link to this challenge's README file.

### Challenge Setup & Execution

**Branch Name:** `tree-fizz-buzz`

**Challenge Type:** Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Feature Tasks

- Write a function called fizz buzz tree
- Arguments: k-ary tree
- Return: new k-ary tree

Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with "Fizz"
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with "Buzz"
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with "FizzBuzz"
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Requirements
