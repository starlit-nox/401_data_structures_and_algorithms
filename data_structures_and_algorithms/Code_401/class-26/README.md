# Insertion Sort

[Refresh your understanding of Big Oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waPQP2TDOGE){:target="_blank"}. 

## Assignment

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

You may review an example document [HERE](../class-26/solutions/BLOG){:target="_blank"}

## Pseudocode

```javascript
  InsertionSort(int[] arr)

    FOR i = 1 to arr.length

      int j <-- i - 1
      int temp <-- arr[i]

      WHILE j >= 0 AND temp < arr[j]
        arr[j + 1] <-- arr[j]
        j <-- j - 1

      arr[j + 1] <-- temp
```

## Sample Arrays

In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

`[8,4,23,42,16,15]`

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

- Reverse-sorted: `[20,18,12,8,5,-2]`
- Few uniques: `[5,12,7,5,5,7]`
- Nearly-sorted: `[2,3,5,7,13,11]`

### Implementation

- Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
- Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
- Present a complete set of working tests

## Requirements

Ensure your complete code solution follows the standard requirements.

1. Write [unit tests](../../Challenge_Testing){:target="_blank"}
1. Follow the [template for a well-formatted README](../../Challenge_Documentation){:target="_blank"}
1. Submit the assignment following [these instructions](../../Challenge_Submission){:target="_blank"}

## Submission

Submit a link to a pull request in your `data-structures-and-algorithms` repository that contains your completed version of the `sorting/insertion/README.md` along with your full working, tested code solution.

## Stretch Goal

Share your article on LinkedIn, so that your network knows how awesome you are.
