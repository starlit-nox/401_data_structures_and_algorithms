# Number Series with the Largest Sum

Source: TA had an interview question

You are given an array of numbers that can include both positive and negative numbers (as well as floats and integers), return the subarray that produces the largest sum. Note: a subarray can have one value, as well as include the entire array.

Ex:
```
input: [-68, -76, 55, -60, 82, -12, -95, 72, 87, 63, -53, -93, 68, -10, -4, 86, 18, -40, 19, -34]

output: [72, 87, 63, -53, -93, 68, -10, -4, 86, 18]
```
